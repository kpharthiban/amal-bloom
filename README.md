## Project Description

Amal Bloom is a web platform designed to enhance the efficiency and transparency of charitable giving in Malaysia. It provides a trusted space for verified Zakat bodies, Waqf managers, and NPOs to list their campaigns. Donations made through the platform are intelligently allocated by our AI engine to active campaigns based on predefined criteria like urgency and impact potential, ensuring funds reach where they are needed most. Donors gain transparency by seeing exactly which campaigns their contributions supported.

## Key Features

* **Verified Organizations:** Platform lists only registered and vetted charitable organizations.
* **Campaign Management:** Organizations can list and manage their specific campaigns/projects.
* **Online Donations:** Secure donation processing via FPX, Card, etc.
* **Offline Donations:** Conceptual channel via partner stores (e.g., 7-Eleven) for cash donations.
* **AI-Powered Allocation:** Core engine that analyzes active campaigns and allocates pooled donations based on urgency, impact, category, and funding needs.
* **Donor Dashboard:** Personalized view for donors showing donation history and AI allocation results.
* **Organization Dashboard:** Tools for organizations to track donations, view allocation reports, and manage campaigns.
* **Transparency:** Clear reporting for both donors (allocation results) and organizations (donation logs, reports).
